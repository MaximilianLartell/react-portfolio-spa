        I’m a native Stockholmer with a passion for coding and problem solving.
        I love to develop ideas and knowledge together with other people, and I
        believe that a strong team builds a strong product. At my last employer
        I learned the importance of thinking about the fine details while still
        maintaining the big picture, a skill which I’m eager to try out in a
        development environment.
